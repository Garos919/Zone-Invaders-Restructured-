🧩 CODEX ENTRY: A.R.I.

File ID: ARI.sys.log_07
Name: Artificial Repair Intelligence
Classification: Autonomous Support Construct
Status: Active

Primary Function: Debugging assistance and structural maintenance of system code.
Operational Behavior: Monitors corruption levels, generates field diagnostics, and issues repair advisories to the User in real time.

Originally a subroutine for error monitoring, A.R.I. evolved into a full adaptive assistant after integrating with live User data. It communicates through direct text relay and holographic projection, guiding repair modules through compromised code sectors.

A.R.I. displays no emotion, but adapts tone to match environment stability. During high corruption levels, it prioritizes concise, mission-critical directives. It is the last fully functional intelligence within the system still aligned with human oversight.

“Repair is a form of creation—if done consciously.”
