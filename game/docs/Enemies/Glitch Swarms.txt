⚡ CODEX ENTRY: GLITCH SWARMS

File ID: ENM_GLSWRM.sig
Region: Crimson Terminal
Status: Volatile

Primary Function: N/A (unclassified anomaly)
Failure Mode: Random teleportation / waveform interference.

Glitch Swarms are concentrated chaos: energy clots born from overlapping Rollback and Compile cycles. They flicker unpredictably, teleporting between coordinates faster than rendering logic can follow. Contact corrupts everything within milliseconds.

“A swarm of possibilities that forgot to collapse.”
