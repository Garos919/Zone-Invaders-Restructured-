⚠️ CODEX ENTRY: PARSE ERRORS

File ID: ERR_PARSE.line
Region: The Neon Kernel
Status: Active

Primary Function: Syntax validation.
Failure Mode: Recursive self-reference.

These fragments are the first stage of system failure — floating remnants of broken statements and incomplete functions. Their bodies flicker between words like if, for, and null, endlessly trying to finish their own line of code.

They drift aimlessly, harmless alone but overwhelming in swarms. Destroying them releases faint text dust that reforms seconds later elsewhere.

“They don’t know what they’re saying. They just keep trying to finish the sentence.”
