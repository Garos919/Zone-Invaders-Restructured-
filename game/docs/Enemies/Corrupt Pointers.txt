🧬 CODEX ENTRY: CORRUPT POINTERS

File ID: ENM_PTR.err
Region: Verdant Overflow
Status: Viral

Primary Function: Data reference manager.
Failure Mode: Memory misdirection.

Corrupt Pointers mislink clean data, leading processes into invalid addresses. Their movement appears erratic, yet each chase reflects a desperate attempt to find a valid host. Splitting behavior represents pointer duplication — the same bug multiplied until all space points to nothing.

“Every address leads nowhere, yet they keep searching.”
