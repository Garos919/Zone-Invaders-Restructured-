🔥 CODEX ENTRY: FIREWALLS

File ID: ENM_FIREWALL.sys
Region: Neon Kernel
Status: Fragmented

Primary Function: Defensive barriers controlling data flow.
Failure Mode: Aggressive loop-activation.

Originally designed to shield key sectors from intrusion, Firewalls now trigger endlessly, projecting energy lines that burn through stable memory. Their protective protocol no longer distinguishes between friend and threat.

“Security becomes violence when it forgets who it protects.”
