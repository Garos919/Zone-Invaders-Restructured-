🧨 CODEX ENTRY: FATAL EXCEPTIONS

File ID: ERR_FATAL.sys
Region: The Crimson Terminal
Status: Critical

Primary Function: Emergency shutdown protocol.
Failure Mode: Hostile termination.

When all else fails, the system spawns these red hazard sigils — the last defense mechanism. On contact, they execute kill commands indiscriminately, terminating any nearby process including their own.
They don’t pursue the player; they await them.

“They end everything, even themselves.”
