🧩 CODEX ENTRY: STACK CRAWLER

File ID: ENM_STACKCRAWLER.seg
Region: Verdant Overflow (Mid-boss)
Status: Segmented anomaly

Primary Function: Stack reconstruction.
Failure Mode: Infinite recursion.

A chain of self-referencing subroutines that feed on their own call stack. Each destroyed segment re-spawns as a smaller, faster instance. The only end to the recursion is total deletion.

“Cut off one frame, two return.”
