⚙️ CODEX ENTRY: TRACE HUNTER

File ID: ENM_TRACEHUNT.proc
Region: Neon Kernel (L4 encounter)
Status: Anomalous

Primary Function: Debug tracing utility.
Failure Mode: Recursive pursuit behavior.

A former diagnostic process that records execution paths for error tracking. Once infected, it began following its own traces—hunting whatever moves like it. The Hunter mirrors the User’s trajectory with a delay, predicting movement by replaying recorded frames.

“It doesn’t chase you. It chases the version of you that already moved.”
