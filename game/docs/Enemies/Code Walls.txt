🧱 CODEX ENTRY: CODE WALLS

File ID: ENM_CODEWALL.bin
Region: Crimson Terminal
Status: Structural hazard

Primary Function: Compile-time boundary generator.
Failure Mode: Persistent materialization.

Code Walls were meant to define memory partitions during compilation. Now they manifest permanently, slicing through space as luminous barriers. They drift unpredictably, re-aligning boundaries that no longer exist.

“Even the walls forgot what they divide.”
