> 🚨 **NOTICE:** Due to browser autoplay policies, sounds may not start automatically when opening through this link.  
> **Audio will enable once you interact with the page (e.g., click anywhere).**  
> **Not compatible with phones (maybe later), only with PCs.**
> Some parts of the game might currently **break or behave unexpectedly**, but I wanted to share it with everyone at this stage for early feedback and discussion.
> 
> **Zone Invaders** originally began as a lighthearted **Zone01-themed parody**, but as usual for me, the more I worked on it, the more I wanted it to become *something more*. *(More on that later.)*  
>
> I’ve been developing this small prototype — currently at **version 0.5.7** — with a focus on the **aesthetic and overall atmosphere** rather than the full gameplay systems. Right now, the gameplay is still **basic and mostly score-based**, but this early phase was about finding the **look, tone, and “soul”** of the idea.  
>
> I’ve learned that I work best when something *feels right first* — if it doesn’t connect with me visually or tonally, I lose interest fast. Now that the aesthetic feels solid, I’m much more motivated to expand the project, and I already have **plans for gameplay systems and mechanics** that will make it more engaging and dynamic.  
>
> Beyond mechanics, I also have a **narrative layer** planned that will use everything you see in this version — the **enemy types**, **obstacles**, and even **A.R.I.**, the small floating character — as integral parts of the story itself.  
>
> I’m **very new to coding** (just entered the Zone01 cohort) and don’t have real experience with **JavaScript, HTML, or CSS** — I built most of this with the help of **GitHub Copilot**.  
> I’d really appreciate if any of the more experienced peers could take a deeper look at the project and give feedback on **what Copilot may have done wrong or inefficiently**. One issue I’ve already noticed myself is that **Copilot tends to leave behind outdated or unused snippets of code**, but there are likely other things I’m unaware of.  
>
> For now, I’m mainly looking for **feedback on the aesthetic and feel** — what works, what doesn’t, and what could give the project a stronger identity.  
>
> Thank you for taking the time to check it out!  
> If you’d like to share feedback, please **reply to my post in the group chat as a new thread** where I’ve shared this link — that way all responses stay organized and won’t clutter the main discussion.  
> You can also ask any questions in the same way and i'd be glad to respond to them.
