TODO: Implement A.R.I. — ASCII-based assistant entity.

A.R.I. is displayed as ASCII text such as <(o-o)>.
It stays at a small fixed size (≈48–64px) and moves smoothly near the player.
The color and glow intensity change according to the current emotion or system state.

Use data from:
  - "ari_visual_identity_framework.txt"
  - "ari_animations.txt"
  - "timing_&_engine_map.txt"

Implementation Requirements:
1. Render ASCII characters directly (no models or sprites).
2. Apply the color and glow values defined in the color map.
3. Update the displayed frame from the active animation at the defined FPS.
4. Interpolate color changes on state transitions.
5. Maintain constant scale.
6. Execute smooth position updates to follow the player with a fixed offset.

API:
  A.R.I.playEmotion(name)
  A.R.I.playSystem(name)
  A.R.I.loop(name)
  A.R.I.stopAll()

Runtime Integration:
  ari.follow(player.x + 40, player.y - 60);
  ari.update(deltaTime);
  ari.render(ctx);
