# defines which loops or overlays are allowed to combine with which state types

emotional_state:
  overlays_allowed:	[blink, talk, talk_glitch, idle, load]
  overlays_blocked:	[glitch_loop, error_flash, scan_flash]

system_state:
  overlays_allowed:	[data_in, data_out, ping, processing, scan_flash, error_flash]
  overlays_blocked:	[talk, blink]

action_loops:
  independent:		[processing, scan, scan_flash, glitch_loop, error_flash]
  dependent:		[talk, talk_glitch, blink, idle, load]

  frame_rate:		fps
  entry_length:		4frames
  loop_behavior:	stop_on_[enter_state]

# behavior notes
# - blink and talk can overlay any emotional state except when system_state active
# - glitch_loop and error_flash override all other expressions while active
# - system_feedback loops (data_in/out/ping) run independently, non-blocking
# - transitions disable loops until [enter_state] reached
